Hello World!
I'm learning to use git by following the git-it tutorial by jlord.
What is git?
Git (a.k.a git) is version control software used to track changes to your projects files 
and allow you to step back easily if a piece of code does'nt work; but there 
is also more! You can also 'push' your repository to a remote server so that
if your local machine fails your project remains safe on the remote repository.
A common place for remote repositories is github.
